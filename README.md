# MNIST GAN: Generative Adversarial Network for MNIST Handwritten Digits

This project implements a **Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)** to generate images of handwritten digits similar to those in the **MNIST dataset**. The GAN consists of a **Generator** that creates fake images and a **Discriminator** that classifies whether an image is real (from the dataset) or fake (generated by the Generator). The two models are trained adversarially to improve their respective capabilities.

## Features

- **Generator**: A neural network that takes random noise as input and generates 28x28 grayscale images.
- **Discriminator**: A neural network that takes 28x28 images as input and predicts if the image is real or fake.
- **MNIST Dataset**: The model is trained on the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits.
- **Training Loop**: Includes adversarial training where the Generator and Discriminator are updated in alternating steps.
- **Visualization**: The model generates new images every few epochs to track progress.

## Dependencies

The project is implemented in **Python** using **PyTorch**. Install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision matplotlib numpy
```


How to Run

Copy code
1. **Clone the Repository**:
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mnist-gan.git
cd mnist-gan
```

3. **Run the Script**:
   Execute the script to train the GAN:
   ```
   python gan_mnist.py
   ```

5. **Monitor Training**:
   - The script prints the **Generator Loss** and **Discriminator Loss** after each epoch.
   - Every 10 epochs, a grid of generated images is displayed to visualize the GAN's progress.


Customization
Hyperparameters:
You can adjust latent_dim, batch_size, epochs, and lr to fine-tune the model.
Latent Space:
Explore the latent space by providing different random noise inputs to the Generator.
